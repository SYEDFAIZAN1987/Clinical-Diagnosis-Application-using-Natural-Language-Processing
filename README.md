🩺 Clinical Diagnosis Application & medReport Model

Welcome to the Clinical Diagnosis Application, a NLP-powered deep learning solution for automated medical diagnosis based on clinical notes. This project leverages BioBERT, Natural Language Processing, and Hugging Face Transformers to analyze patient reports and predict diseases with high accuracy.

🚀 Live Model Hosted on Hugging Face: DrSyedFaizan/medReport

🔬 Overview
medReport is a fine-tuned BioBERT model trained on clinical text data to predict diseases based on patient reports. The associated Clinical Diagnosis App allows users to upload medical notes (PDF/TXT) and receive disease predictions along with recommended medications and specialists.

✨ Features
✅ Fine-tuned BioBERT Model for medical text classification
✅ Predict diseases from clinical notes
✅ Extract text from PDFs and TXT files
✅ Recommend medications & specialists based on prediction
✅ Streamlit-powered web app for easy access
✅ Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces / Local Server

📌 Model Details
The medReport model is fine-tuned on a clinical notes dataset using BioBERT, a biomedical NLP model. It has been trained for multi-label classification, allowing it to predict diseases from unstructured clinical text.

🔗 Load the Model
You can access the trained model directly via Hugging Face:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import pickle
import torch

# Load Model & Tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("DrSyedFaizan/medReport")
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("DrSyedFaizan/medReport")

# Load Label Encoder
label_encoder_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="DrSyedFaizan/medReport", filename="label_encoder.pkl")
with open(label_encoder_path, "rb") as f:
    label_encoder = pickle.load(f)

✅ Trained on BioBERT
✅ Optimized with AdamW
✅ Fine-tuned for Clinical NLP

📖 Usage
🔹 Predict Disease from a Clinical Note
python
Copy
Edit
def predict_disease(text, model, tokenizer, label_encoder):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.logits
    predicted_label = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()
    return label_encoder.inverse_transform([predicted_label])[0]
🎨 Web App UI (Streamlit)
The Streamlit UI allows drag & drop of PDF/TXT files for quick disease predictions.

📥 Upload Clinical Notes
1️⃣ Upload clinical notes (PDF or TXT)
2️⃣ Extract text from reports
3️⃣ Predict disease
4️⃣ Get medication & specialist recommendations

🏥 Example Predictions
Clinical Note	Predicted Disease	Medications	Specialists
"Patient reports persistent heartburn..."	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)	Omeprazole, Ranitidine	Gastroenterologist
"Male patient with history of smoking, chronic cough..."	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)	Tiotropium, Albuterol	Pulmonologist
"Elderly patient with diabetes, experiencing numbness..."	Diabetic Neuropathy	Metformin, Insulin	Endocrinologist
